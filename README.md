# WAYST RECYCLING (FKA CARUS)

## OVERVIEW

Wayst Recycling is a decentralized recycling platform that allows users to get incentivized through the Celo dollar (cUSD) by scheduling waste pick-ups and drop-offs effortlessly for recycling. The company's mission is to transform the way the world recycles and disposes of waste, transitioning toward a truly circular economy.

## KEY OFFERINGS
- ### Effortless Scheduling of Waste Pick-up and Drop-off:
Wayst provides an intuitive platform for users to schedule convenient waste and recycling pickups from their homes or businesses. Users can input their location and select preferred pickup dates/times, streamlining the waste management process. The scheduling system optimizes pickup routes to improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Wayst Recycling maintains a network of strategically located dropoff centers for users to conveniently deposit recyclables and waste, with locations mapped out based on user density and accessibility.

- ### Blockchain-Enabled Recycling Rewards:
Wayst Recycling has developed a cryptocurrency-based rewards system that incentivizes responsible recycling behavior. Consumers can earn "The Celo Dollar (cUSD)" for properly sorting and depositing recyclables, which can then be redeemed or donated. 

- ### Closed-Loop Recycling Ecosystems:
Wayst Recycling partners with local governments, businesses, and recycling facilities to build integrated recycling hubs that optimize material flows and minimize waste. These ecosystems incorporate reverse logistics, material processing, and end-product manufacturing to create a truly circular system.

- ### Sustainable Material Innovation:
Wayst Recycling will have a research and development team that is continually exploring new recycling technologies and materials to reduce waste and environmentalÂ impact.
